# Recruitment Test for Full Stack Position

- Please use real Github accounts, we want to check your contributions history. Since we use, create, and contribute to open source.
- Everyone work with the same set of information, to let us fairly judge your work.
- We are answering questions only when it's strictly necessary.
- The test is designed in a way, that can confuse you or seems weird because we want to test you in a way worse environment than you will work on a daily basis. It's also not a representation of the tech stack we are using in real projects.
- You need to create a repository on GitHub to commit your changes and share the repository URL with us when you are done.

## Before you start

- Fork this repository, it needs to stay on Github, publicly available.
- Take in mind the User Experience UX. We are evaluating the usability of the user interface.
- Be sure all the assets are in the project before sending.

## Task 1

From the following array, reverse it, but keep the special characters in the same position.

```
[n,2,&,a,l,9,$,q,47,i,a,j,b,z,%,8]
```

In this case:

- `&` must be in position 2
- `$` must be in position 6
- `%` must be in position 14

The solution needs to be dynamic (if the special character's position changed, keep it as same).

## Task 2

From the Dog API fetch the following data:

- List all the dog breeds
- Show the dog image and name
- Add hover state to dog image to show the first three dog sub-breeds
- Don‚Äôt use any CSS library or framework
- Follow the UI Mockup to complete this task.
